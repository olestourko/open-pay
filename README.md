## Open Pay
A web application for sharing local tech industry compensation. It aims to freely provide compensation data to students, employees, and employers in the local tech industry
 so they can make informed career and hiring decisions.

### Key Project Features

- Capture data beyond only salary:
 employee benefits, specific tools used in a job, years with current employer, total number of employers during career, etc...
- Anonymous and verified submissions: using any email, or using a "verified" email based on whitelisted domains. Specific emails addresses will never be shared.
- Segmented data by year - allow multiple submissions from the same sources every year in order to keep the data up to date.
- A side tool for valuing non-salary benefits using [NPV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp) calculations.

### Option 1: Running With Docker 

You can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to create a container which will grab all of the dependencies for you.
  ```
docker build -t open-tech-pay .
```

You'll need to run the database migrations and seed the database if you haven't:
```
docker run -v full/path/to/app:/app -p 5000:5000 --net="host" open-tech-pay flask db init
docker run -v full/path/to/app:/app -p 5000:5000 --net="host" open-tech-pay flask db migrate
docker run -v full/path/to/app:/app -p 5000:5000 --net="host" open-tech-pay flask db upgrade
docker run -v full/path/to/app:/app -p 5000:5000 --net="host" open-tech-pay python utils/seeding/seed_core.py
```

Install frontend packages and compile SASS:
```
docker run -v full/path/to/app:/app -p 5000:5000 --net="host" open-tech-pay yarn install
docker run -v full/path/to/app:/app -p 5000:5000 --net="host" open-tech-pay sass --watch sass:src/static/stylesheets
```

Run the application container:
```
docker run -v full/path/to/app:/app -p 5000:5000 --net="host" open-tech-pay
```
or
```
docker-compose up
```

### Option 2: Installing Dependencies


**[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/)**: The web application framework.

```
pip install flask
```

**[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)**: The ORM.

```
pip install psycopg2-binary # using postgreSQL instead of MySQL
pip install sqlalchemy
```

**Flask Extensions**

```
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
pip install flask-migrate
pip install flask-mail
```

**[Marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**:  Model mapper for SQLAlchemy model -> JSON.

```
pip install marshmallow
```

#### Running It

First get the dependencies above, then...

Set your `PYTHONPATH`  
[PyCharm](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28326362/pycharm-and-pythonpath):
```
cd /path/to/project/
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
```

**Initial Migrations and Seeding**

First specify your database credentials in a file called `/config.py`. (check out /`example_config.py`)

```
export CONFIG_FILEPATH=$(pwd)/config.py
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
python utils/seeding/seed_core.py
```

**Compile SASS:**  
If you don't have SASS, [install it](https://sass-lang.com/install) first.
```
sass --watch sass:src/static/stylesheets
```

**Install Frontend Dependencies with YARN:**  
If you don't have Yarn, [install it](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) first.
```
yarn install
```


**Start the Flask server**

From the `open-pay` directory:
```
export FLASK_APP=$(pwd)/src/application.py
flask run
```
Note: You should use a proper application server like uWSGI in production, but this is good enough for demo purposes.

---

#### Unit tests
They're in the `/tests` folder. Similar to running the application, set an env variable with the config file location. You should set up a seperate DB just for tests.
```
python -m unittest discover
```

#### Resources

##### PostgreSQL
[Installing on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-16-04)  
[Usage with Flask](https://suhas.org/sqlalchemy-tutorial/)

##### Email
Transactional emails are sent with the [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) because it manages to avoid spam filters pretty well.
Alternatively, you can send emails directly - check out the `own-emails` branch to see how.
